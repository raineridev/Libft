# Libft

My first library using  C

## What is this library for?
This is 42Lisboa's first project, to create my own C library. It's a set of numerous functions that are useful in everyday life, such as calloc.

## Why recreate it? It's reinventing the wheel?
Some may see it that way, but I don't. In recreating these functions, I used a lot of logic and learned a lot about how they really work

## Installation

Clone the repository

```bash
https://github.com/raineridev/Libft.git
```
Use the `make` command to compile all the c files

To clear the object files run this command
```
make clean
```
